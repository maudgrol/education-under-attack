# Education under attack data dashboard

This example data dashboard was created using a [dataset](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/eua-2018) that I accessed through the Humanitarian Data Exchange, which was originally extracted from the 2018 edition of the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA)â€™s flagship report, Education Under Attack. For more information, visit [Education under Attack 2018](eua2018.protectingeducation.org) or [Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack](protectingeducation.org).

## Code
The dashboard is built with R using the Rmarkdown framework.
