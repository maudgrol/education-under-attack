Data Information {.sidebar data-width=300}
=====================================

This dataset is extracted from the 2018 edition of the Global Coalition to Protect Education from Attack (GCPEA)’s flagship report, Education Under Attack. The report is the result of independent research conducted by GCPEA. Generous support for the report was provided by the Education Above All Foundation, the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and an anonymous donor. Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health contributed in-kind research support. For more information, visit eua2018.protectingeducation.org or protectingeducation.org.
